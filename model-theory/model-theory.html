  <h3> Abstract </h3>
  <p  class="lead">
  The course is an introduction to model theory: a branch of
  mathematics that deals with the classification of structures by
  means of logical formulas. Mathematical structures (groups, rings,
  fields, ordered sets, lattices, and others) can be classified
  according to the logical formulas that are true in them. Conversely,
  given some logical formulas, one wants to find classes of structures
  in which the formulas are true. We call those structures `models' of
  the formulas; moreover, when S is the class of all models of a set F
  of formulas, we say that F is a `theory' of S; hence, the name of
  model theory. Historically, mathematicians have used models all the
  time, they just did not build a theory around it. For example, to
  demonstrate that Euclid's fifth postulate does not follow from the
  rest, one can take a sphere: a (non-standard) model of all the
  postulates except the fifth. Model theory however is relatively
  young, it did not exist before the second half of the 20th Century. </p>

  In addition, this course provides the foundations of software
  specification and formal verification of systems from the
  perspective of the work on algebraic specification. It also
  introduces some basic concepts necessary for the design of an
  algebraic-specification language. One important characteristic of
  the present course is the use of many-sorted first-order structures
  (instead of single-sorted structures), which consist of collections
  of sets (of data values) together with functions and relations over
  those sets. Each such structure can be regarded as a model of a
  concrete software system.  Therefore, we can learn a lot about
  software systems by analyzing their model theory. This abstraction
  corresponds to the view that the correctness of the input/output
  behaviour of a software system takes precedence over other
  properties such as efficiency.</p>
